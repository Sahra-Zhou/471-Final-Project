Final Project Description:
This is a tiny game that you hang around in a flower field while the owner is not very friendly. The player can use arrow keys to control the character to move around. When the character approaches the owner, he'll start waving and jumping to warn you and if you insist to move closer, he'll start chasing after you. The game restarts when you are caught.
